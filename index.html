    <p>I have lived all my life in Scotland, but the United Kingdom is where I call home.</p>


    <p>The UK is awesome, it's not a single country; being primarily composed of four countries, with a largely centralised governing structure, but distinct
    legal and parliamentary systems. It has worked pretty well for Scotland over the last several hundred years, evolving out of countries that used to often
    be in conflict over resource allocation or ideology, into a vibrant multicultural community without internal borders, free-trade and unified healthcare. In
    the last referendum I was fiercely supportive of maintaining this Union.</p>


    <p>As the world got bigger and better connected a larger group of countries, that too had often found themselves in similar conflict, got together and
    formed a much looser alliance that shared many of these characteristics. Formed with similar goals but updated to allow members to participate at a level
    that was most appropriate for them. It's worked pretty well, with a Parliamentary system that shares many similarities to the Westminster, though with much
    less power over it’s member states. It has demonstrated it’s democratic credentials admirably, not forcing member states to take part in programs they
    didn’t originally sign up too; like the single currency. Though this sounds pretty idyllic, life's not perfect, it never is, and unfortunately the nature
    of true democracy means that there will always have to be a level of compromise between parties.</p>


    <p>The populations of two of the members of the United Kingdom; England and Wales have just voted to leave the EU in a democratically held referendum, and
    isolate themselves from the global community. The other members of the UK, including Scotland, wish to remain. Considering the nature of this vote, and its
    impact on the quality of life that will result from exiting the EU; it would surely be a violation of our rights to forcibly remove us from a political
    union against our expressed will; which is what will happen if England and Wales force the other member states of the UK to leave the EU.</p>


    <p>This cannot be allowed to happen, if the rhetoric of the Leave campaign has any level of sincerity, then it would surely follow that England and Wales
    should leave the Union of the United Kingdom, letting them be truly free to form new relationships with outer countries, while also respecting the wishes
    of the majority of their own populations and those of the members that chose to remain. They must be able to see the clear hypocrisy of wanting to leave
    the EU as a result of feeling that they were receiving unwanted external influence, and then immediately implementing clear and direct measures against the
    wishes of their oldest and closest allies.</p>


    <p>I hope I am not forced to vote for Scotland to remove itself from the treacherous path that the parliamentarians of England and Wales are seemingly
    determined to take the UK down, but a line in the sand is potentially about to be crossed. I hope that David Cameron’s successor works towards implementing
    a solution that leaves Scotland, NI and Gibraltar a members of the EU. I can not see any other course of action as anything less than an act of political,
    social and economic malice; and we must defend and protect ourselves from such persecution. If we are dragged out of the EU as a member of the the UK, then
    that's a UK that is no longer composed of United Kingdoms, and one I can no longer think of as a home.</p>
